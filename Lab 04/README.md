## Test Dev
I decided to develop the tic project. In tic_java, I have the Tic.java class within the src folder. This class contains 1 method that initializes the tictactoe board with empty slots. Due to the simplicity of this method, no code refactoring was needed when making the test cases. Below you will find my commits that I made for the pass/fail test casses used in the test folder of the tic_java direcotry. I ran these tests in Intellij IDE. 

Each commit group starts with a failed test, followed by a passed one:
